    <p class="quote">The interpreter is a mirror, and performing music doesn't mean contaminating the piece with your own personality, it consists in performing <i>all</i> the music, nothing more and nothing less. [...] Failing that, performers start to 'interpret', and it's that that I'm against. (Richter, 2001)</p>
    <i>Begin by wearing clean cotton gloves. Gently dust it using a soft and dry brush without much pressure. Then, close the cabinet and wipe the glass both inside and out. Don't forget to put the security cord back. When you are finished, get out of the way and leave the room quickly; the next visitors will come soon and you can not be seen!</i>
